            I Want To Time Travel To That Stage
                I'll picture that time in my head. I forgot everything so I wanna see it again, I wanna time travel 60 years back to see your beautiful eyes once again.
            <br>
            <br>
            Travelling is an experience that can teach us so many things that you cannot possibly learn while living at home. Firstly, it teaches you how to make new friends. The world is full of people who love interacting. You get to make friends when you travel to new places and spend quality time with them.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
            <br>
            <br>
            After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.
